# Novel Analysis to Identify Kurt Vonnegut's "Shape of Stories" Theory and Analyze the Correlation Between Old and New Novels and A.I Generated Novels to Reform the Current A.I Models

This research delves into the realm of narrative analysis, examining the alignment of narratives from different centuries and AI-generated stories with Kurt Vonnegut's renowned "shape of stories" theory. Through the comprehensive analysis of over 120 human-written narratives spanning the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, as well as AI-generated novels, this study offers a unique and thorough exploration. Employing sentiment analysis methods, the research scrutinizes the emotional trajectories of these narratives, revealing intriguing insights into their conformity with Vonnegut's narrative patterns. The findings were illuminating. They revealed that Vonnegut's theory holds substantial validity of the narratives analyzed aligning with his proposed shapes of stories. Additionally, AI-generated narratives displayed a considerable degree of conformity to Vonnegut's patterns, but with occasional inconsistencies in emotional trajectories. The research not only contributes to the understanding of narrative structures but also establishes a foundation for training AI to craft advanced and distinct narratives. In this context, AI-generated narratives reveal an ongoing need for human intervention to infuse emotional depth and consistency. This research's findings hold significant implications for literary analysis, storytelling, AI development, and creative writing education, benefiting researchers, writers, educators, and AI developers alike.
